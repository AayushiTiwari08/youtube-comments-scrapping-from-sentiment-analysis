Peak Samsung - over-innovating things nobody needs...Samsung should bring the feature of video recording or saving in rewind &amp; fast forward mode in Note20ultra5g.<br /><br /><br />If this feature introduced in the samsung upcoming update then it would be considered a cool feature.On the top, this make samsung more distinct as no other phone in market have this.<br /><br />And user can edit the video in rewind &amp; fast forward mode\\xa0<br /><br /><br />User can able to make some cool stuff from this feature.\\xa0<br /><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23samsung\">#Samsung</a> please think about this.Samsung -we touch your heart ❤️ <br />Apple -we touch your kidneys 😂😂😂I threw my iphone OVER THE HORIZON 😂😂😂when is this availableSamsung the best 💪🏼✌👊I can&#39;t wait to play realistic football in my Samsung Smart Monitor!when can i order it in hong kong ?Ordered one Today.

As for the Note 30 or Note 21 series I want it you can do better in terms of design for it to look like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I know this is my subjective assessment but probably a lot of people also think like me and I hope Samsung can meet the needs of a customer or a fan of Samsung like me in particular and of everyone in general.What&#39;s th. Cost SamThat guy was playing a live football match? Oh...Dang she cute lolNext time make the speakers front firing for the 2nd gen smart monitor.<br /><br />Also, can you make an OLED version as an option with 120Hz???

Wait what? Cannot do that on my Tab S7+ unless I tap the send button or mouse over and click it. <br /><br />As for the video, this monitor looks neat. Hope it is priced decently, maybe will pick it up.Samsung DeX is the most useful feature today and apple will take another 2yrs to bring something like that. Hope at least they will get rid of that notch.

Cette période de confinement étant compliqué financièrement pour certains, je peux vous présenter une opportunité qui peut améliorer cela. Nous avons déjà aidé plusieurs personnes, surtout en ce moment. Il faut juste être majeur. Je cherche des personnes qui en ont marre d&#39;en avoir marre, qui veulent plus de liberté, quitter (ou non) leur travail à l&#39;avenir, qui en ont marre de travailler pour un patron, qui ont des objectifs de vie à réaliser, ou encore qui veulent entreprendre leur vie. C&#39;est un travail sérieux, si vous ne vous reconnaissez pas merci de passer votre chemin. Si vous êtes intéressé merci de me contacter sur mon FB: Laurie Dunez. À très bientôt :)I wish this monitor had a adjustable stand like Lg ergo monitor 😒  either way i love this product more than anyother monitor in market but a humble request from me is to make a awsome bazel less monitor just like this with a maximum adjustable features with less stand space pleaseI actually kinda want that monitor for my channel but not bad not badEven tho I&#39;m an apple fan Samsung I&#39;m a bit impressed just don&#39;t like ur phonesI like Samsung galaxy note 20 ULTRA 12 GB RAM / 512 GB internal resmi luar negeri<br />Chat aku di wa ku 081243902179this song and samsung rocksWho heard the navi LISTEN? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKeRM918XDA&amp;t=0m39s\">0:39</a>One question,why i want to pay for exynos, why?Super 👌<b><i>samsung being samsung with their innovations</i></b><br /><br /><b><i>whereas Apple is busy blocking their comment section</i></b>Единственное место где это работает - только в этом роликеUnavailable in the U.S?

I hope samsung fixes themWhere I can find the wallpaper 0:48?Am I the only one who absolutely don&#39;t care about the product but really love the music of the spot?!0:52socks and sandalsSong?This has low reviews on Best Buy but I still want to try itLG,LG()  LG    ,( ). ~ 1  .  5  . 7~8 ...   DEX   M7 .  ~~Has the quality control on M7 been resolved? cause the initial reception of end-user experience doesn&#39;t seem that great regarding failure.When they were getting notifications I thought it was my phoneSocks and flip flops though :)In real life that woman would weigh 185 lbs.People need to chill its literally a monitorI love the tap view feature so much!mahal kayaknyaIs it me, or are PC monitors are now becoming like Smart TVs?I wantIt&#39;s a TV with size of MonitorsAll the reviews coming out for this monitor are bad. People are saying the picture is very dark and they die within hours of getting startedi saw one for all and came forgot this was a samsung vidWhat about color calibration for video/photo editing?I am stupid so I am asking if this is a PC and if I can game on itwhen you have money for $1300 phone but can&#39;t afford a laptopShigarki would be truly interested in buying this!We are all watching this on our samsung phones0:46Wireless DeX is also available on the S10 series, Note10 series, some A series phones and the original Galaxy Fold.We want dex in a50sWaiting for another model with 120hz. I&#39;d be fine paying another $150 for a more premium model. Also I want Samsung to have a unique monitor design. Like the center hole punch for phones, the Samsung on the mid left on the back of laptops, and I want a unique Design for samsung monitors, so when someone sees that Design, people go &quot;oh thats a Samsung monitor&quot;Idk why but samsung ads always satisfying :&quot;) like i wanna have &quot;smart&quot; environment tooWoww that awesomeIf that guy was playing Fifa on M&amp;K. He deserves credit, cause that&#39;s hard.Apple is betterIf there&#39;s portable monitor would be fantastic !! Then we can bigger our phone screen for outdoor  instead of having a tablet... Who agrees? How much is it?  Can Samsung gift me for Christmas? Not samsung deleting their pfp lol#werkwerki want oneugly editla phone at the minute 1:010:39navi is that you ?Only samsung is the one busy doing some real innovations Ok this looks sickWhy is that man playing while watching an actual match ?Like when that notification sound came I thought o got a msg and went to check the message what is the model of the monitorI thought this would be a Note ad. I buy now....it&#39;s a nice monitorBelieve me,it doesn&#39;t happen that fast.this is truly awesome. this could be the future of computer, without the personal computer anymore. the only concern is playback quality: dex mode streaming speed, FPS, and the response time and colors quality, and the extend of sound latency of video playback.WOWIm jealousI guess it&#39;s one for all except gaming with 60 Hz refresh rate and 8ms response time... Wish Samsung could put a real one for all together.      At 1:44the monitor isn&#39;t connected to any powerSo the monitor is so good that FIFA players became real can a mac mini be attached to this monitor ?Great. However, not all apps are compatible to take up the whole screen. Say a banking app, it&#39;d just take up the middle screen and you can&#39;t open it to take the whole screen.Why wont you get a TV for all of this?! Peak Samsung - over-innovating things nobody needs...Samsung should bring the feature of video recording or saving in rewind &amp; fast forward mode in Note20ultra5g.If this feature introduced in the samsung upcoming update then it would be considered a cool feature.On the top, this make samsung more distinct as no other phone in market have this.And user can edit the video in rewind &amp; fast forward mode User can able to make some cool stuff from this feature. #Samsungplease think about this.Samsung -we touch your heart  Apple -we touch your kidneys I threw my iphone OVER THE HORIZON when is this availableSamsung the best I can&#39;t wait to play realistic football in my Samsung Smart Monitor!when can i order it in hong kong ?Ordered one Today.

Most people simple have a laptop or/and PC. It is like Chromebook... Looks cool and is cost effective I guess0:28Old Skyline notificationThey should make this monitor with 120hz refresh rate then it would be perfectwho dat chick? instagram?Android on mobile phone is a mess. Android on PC must be something bigger....something to make you to commit suicide. Asians can only make a copy. Innovations is made somewhere else...you know whereThat is the most annoying and ancient notification text I have ever heard.I hear alot of rumors sayx note Will be replaced by fold. Pls don&#39;t do that Samsung Wow it is perfect, no words to saySomeone will soon ask if this monitor is 120hz refresh rate, like everything now a day should be all about gaming..2011212357Me: I need a smart TVYouTube recommendation: <b>After spending much on smart TV</b>YouTube recommendation: Smart Monitor: The One For All Life&#39;s TasksSo really, no one is gonna talk about that guy pretending to play FIFA on this thing while in actuality the footage was of a live football/socer-game?But can it run crysisI heard a Navi LISTEN in thereThis looks useful, but plugging in a Chromebook/box would be more useful.Shut up and take my moneyPlay the video No Prime video Looks interestingSamsung can commentAnd thats goodwe want Snapdragon in India or else only oneplus preferred!I miss not having the pulse oximeter on my new Galaxy S20+ 5G :(I will continue using Samsung till I dieI hope to find a job at Samsung one dayGreat work Samsung Samsung please make more  productivity apps to run in Dex to attract more people to use the platform. 90% of them already exist but please make an app like LumaFusion in Dex.... We will have a full pc like experience and truly use Dex every day without going back to main pc. That will be nice  (ps: forget about adobe rush...)ALTRO CHE APPLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEwhy only china ?Need to find out that girls instagram help me out boys and girls!Now I&#39;m hearing y&#39;all ending the note series Whats the name of this monitor? How much does it coast?Was that fifa 2077? 1:33&quot;Samsung monitor: The One for All Life&#39;s Tasks&quot;Me: ALLLLLLLLLLL MIGHTOOOOOOOOOOOOeh, an iMac would look more aesthetic in that architecture.  If apple  were to make this monitor  how much do you think it would cost ??   Comment Here ! not oled =&gt; backlight bleed, color shift from the sides, poor darks, poor contrast, not life likeI want and hope Samsung will let the next smartphone S30 or S21 series have the same back design as the Samsung Galaxy S10 Series, because I find it the best design that I have ever seen on Samsung smartphones. As for the Note 30 or Note 21 series I want it you can do better in terms of design for it to look like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I know this is my subjective assessment but probably a lot of people also think like me and I hope Samsung can meet the needs of a customer or a fan of Samsung like me in particular and of everyone in general.What&#39;s th. Cost SamThat guy was playing a live football match? Oh...Dang she cute lolNext time make the speakers front firing for the 2nd gen smart monitor.Also, can you make an OLED version as an option with 120Hz??? PLEASE AND THANK YOU.SO RICH Samsung &gt; Anyone else hear that legend of zelda fairy or was it just meWhen in Italy?Price is just 699$.0:44I think this is the smaller version of Samsung TVNice but... Where is the cam?I adopted a new hobby during the lockdown.........Watching things I cannot affordI&#39;m wondering what kind of technology they use for their officeIl lavoro di sveva gioiaI hope you created a 144 GHz referesh rate monitorTypes of sharing in order :-1.Cast screen2.Air drop- air play3.Cable connected samsung dex4.(After5 years) wireless dex- still doesnt have straight approach connecting  phone to pc or laptop , or android to android without cable or third party-And people pretend like let it be.#hateexynosTV plus monitor !!!!Man types text and sends it from the keyboard? Wait what? Cannot do that on my Tab S7+ unless I tap the send button or mouse over and click it. As for the video, this monitor looks neat. Hope it is priced decently, maybe will pick it up.Samsung DeX is the most useful feature today and apple will take another 2yrs to bring something like that. Hope at least they will get rid of that notch. Instead of removing stuff from the box.Meanwhile : Hello I&#39;m Rob Jobs &amp; my job is to rob.Now this is the true reduction of carbon footprint rather than selling chargers separatelyok it just a samsung tv that look like a monitorINSANE !!

DEX   M7 .  ~~Has the quality control on M7 been resolved? cause the initial reception of end-user experience doesn&#39, t seem that great regarding failure.When they were getting notifications I thought it was my phoneSocks and flip flops though :)In real life that woman would weigh 185 lbs.People need to chill its literally a monitorI love the tap view feature so much!mahal kayaknyaIs it me, or are PC monitors are now becoming like Smart TVs?I wantIt&#39, s a TV with size of MonitorsAll the reviews coming out for this monitor are bad. People are saying the picture is very dark and they die within hours of getting startedi saw one for all and came forgot this was a samsung vidWhat about color calibration for video/photo editing?I am stupid so I am asking if this is a PC and if I can game on itwhen you have money for $1300 phone but can&#39, t afford a laptopShigarki would be truly interested in buying this!We are all watching this on our samsung phones0:46Wireless DeX is also available on the S10 series, Note10 series, some A series phones and the original Galaxy Fold.We want dex in a50sWaiting for another model with 120hz. I&#39, d be fine paying another $150 for a more premium model. Also I want Samsung to have a unique monitor design. Like the center hole punch for phones, the Samsung on the mid left on the back of laptops, and I want a unique Design for samsung monitors, so when someone sees that Design, people go &quot, oh thats a Samsung monitor&quot, Idk why but samsung ads always satisfying :&quot, ) like i wanna have &quot, smart&quot,  environment tooWoww that awesomeIf that guy was playing Fifa on M&amp, K. He deserves credit, cause that&#39, s hard.Apple is betterIf there&#39, s portable monitor would be fantastic !! Then we can bigger our phone screen for outdoor  instead of having a tablet... Who agrees? How much is it?  Can Samsung gift me for Christmas? Not samsung deleting their pfp lol#werkwerki want oneugly editla phone at the minute 1:010:39navi is that you ?Only samsung is the one busy doing some real innovations Ok this looks sickWhy is that man playing while watching an actual match ?Like when that notification sound came I thought o got a msg and went to check the message what is the model of the monitorI thought this would be a Note ad. I buy now....it&#39, s a nice monitorBelieve me,it doesn&#39, t happen that fast.this is truly awesome. this could be the future of computer, without the personal computer anymore. the only concern is playback quality: dex mode streaming speed, FPS, and the response time and colors quality, and the extend of sound latency of video playback.WOWIm jealousI guess it&#39, s one for all except gaming with 60 Hz refresh rate and 8ms response time... Wish Samsung could put a real one for all together.      At 1:44the monitor isn&#39, t connected to any powerSo the monitor is so good that FIFA players became real can a mac mini be attached to this monitor ?Great. However, not all apps are compatible to take up the whole screen. Say a banking app, it&#39, d just take up the middle screen and you can&#39, t open it to take the whole screen.Why wont you get a TV for all of this?! Peak Samsung - over-innovating things nobody needs...Samsung should bring the feature of video recording or saving in rewind &amp,  fast forward mode in Note20ultra5g.If this feature introduced in the samsung upcoming update then it would be considered a cool feature.On the top, this make samsung more distinct as no other phone in market have this.And user can edit the video in rewind &amp,  fast forward mode User can able to make some cool stuff from this feature. #Samsungplease think about this.Samsung -we touch your heart  Apple -we touch your kidneys I threw my iphone OVER THE HORIZON when is this availableSamsung the best I can&#39, t wait to play realistic football in my Samsung Smart Monitor!when can i order it in hong kong ?Ordered one Today.

Most people simple have a laptop or/and PC. It is like Chromebook... Looks cool and is cost effective I guess0:28Old Skyline notificationThey should make this monitor with 120hz refresh rate then it would be perfectwho dat chick? instagram?Android on mobile phone is a mess. Android on PC must be something bigger....something to make you to commit suicide. Asians can only make a copy. Innovations is made somewhere else...you know whereThat is the most annoying and ancient notification text I have ever heard.I hear alot of rumors sayx note Will be replaced by fold. Pls don&#39, t do that Samsung Wow it is perfect, no words to saySomeone will soon ask if this monitor is 120hz refresh rate, like everything now a day should be all about gaming..2011212357Me: I need a smart TVYouTube recommendation: <b>After spending much on smart TV</b>YouTube recommendation: Smart Monitor: The One For All Life&#39, s TasksSo really, no one is gonna talk about that guy pretending to play FIFA on this thing while in actuality the footage was of a live football/socer-game?But can it run crysisI heard a Navi LISTEN in thereThis looks useful, but plugging in a Chromebook/box would be more useful.Shut up and take my moneyPlay the video No Prime video Looks interestingSamsung can commentAnd thats goodwe want Snapdragon in India or else only oneplus preferred!I miss not having the pulse oximeter on my new Galaxy S20+ 5G :(I will continue using Samsung till I dieI hope to find a job at Samsung one dayGreat work Samsung Samsung please make more  productivity apps to run in Dex to attract more people to use the platform. 90% of them already exist but please make an app like LumaFusion in Dex....

How much does it coast?Was that fifa 2077? 1:33&quot, Samsung monitor: The One for All Life&#39, s Tasks&quot, Me: ALLLLLLLLLLL MIGHTOOOOOOOOOOOOeh, an iMac would look more aesthetic in that architecture.  If apple  were to make this monitor  how much do you think it would cost ??   Comment Here ! not oled =&gt,  backlight bleed, color shift from the sides, poor darks, poor contrast, not life likeI want and hope Samsung will let the next smartphone S30 or S21 series have the same back design as the Samsung Galaxy S10 Series, because I find it the best design that I have ever seen on Samsung smartphones. As for the Note 30 or Note 21 series I want it you can do better in terms of design for it to look like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I know this is my subjective assessment but probably a lot of people also think like me and I hope Samsung can meet the needs of a customer or a fan of Samsung like me in particular and of everyone in general.What&#39, s th. Cost SamThat guy was playing a live football match? Oh...Dang she cute lolNext time make the speakers front firing for the 2nd gen smart monitor.Also, can you make an OLED version as an option with 120Hz??? PLEASE AND THANK YOU.SO RICH Samsung &gt,  Anyone else hear that legend of zelda fairy or was it just meWhen in Italy?Price is just 699$.0:44I think this is the smaller version of Samsung TVNice but... Where is the cam?I adopted a new hobby during the lockdown.........Watching things I cannot affordI&#39, m wondering what kind of technology they use for their officeIl lavoro di sveva gioiaI hope you created a 144 GHz referesh rate monitorTypes of sharing in order :-1.Cast screen2.Air drop- air play3.Cable connected samsung dex4.(After5 years) wireless dex- still doesnt have straight approach connecting  phone to pc or laptop , or android to android without cable or third party-And people pretend like let it be.#hateexynosTV plus monitor !!!!Man types text and sends it from the keyboard? Wait what? Cannot do that on my Tab S7+ unless I tap the send button or mouse over and click it. As for the video, this monitor looks neat.

I hope samsung fixes themWhere I can find the wallpaper 0:48?Am I the only one who absolutely don&#39, t care about the product but really love the music of the spot?!0:52socks and sandalsSong?This has low reviews on Best Buy but I still want to try itLG,LG()  LG    ,( ). ~ 1  .  5  . 7~8 ...   DEX   M7 .  ~~Has the quality control on M7 been resolved? cause the initial reception of end-user experience doesn&#39, t seem that great regarding failure.When they were getting notifications I thought it was my phoneSocks and flip flops though :)In real life that woman would weigh 185 lbs.People need to chill its literally a monitorI love the tap view feature so much!mahal kayaknyaIs it me, or are PC monitors are now becoming like Smart TVs?I wantIt&#39, s a TV with size of MonitorsAll the reviews coming out for this monitor are bad. People are saying the picture is very dark and they die within hours of getting startedi saw one for all and came forgot this was a samsung vidWhat about color calibration for video/photo editing?I am stupid so I am asking if this is a PC and if I can game on itwhen you have money for $1300 phone but can&#39, t afford a laptopShigarki would be truly interested in buying this!We are all watching this on our samsung phones0:46Wireless DeX is also available on the S10 series, Note10 series, some A series phones and the original Galaxy Fold.We want dex in a50sWaiting for another model with 120hz. I&#39, d be fine paying another $150 for a more premium model. Also I want Samsung to have a unique monitor design. Like the center hole punch for phones, the Samsung on the mid left on the back of laptops, and I want a unique Design for samsung monitors, so when someone sees that Design, people go &quot, oh thats a Samsung monitor&quot, Idk why but samsung ads always satisfying :&quot, ) like i wanna have &quot, smart&quot,  environment tooWoww that awesomeIf that guy was playing Fifa on M&amp, K. He deserves credit, cause that&#39, s hard.Apple is betterIf there&#39, s portable monitor would be fantastic !! Then we can bigger our phone screen for outdoor  instead of having a tablet... Who agrees? How much is it?  Can Samsung gift me for Christmas? Not samsung deleting their pfp lol#werkwerki want oneugly editla phone at the minute 1:010:39navi is that you ?Only samsung is the one busy doing some real innovations Ok this looks sickWhy is that man playing while watching an actual match ?Like when that notification sound came I thought o got a msg and went to check the message what is the model of the monitorI thought this would be a Note ad. I buy now....it&#39, s a nice monitorBelieve me,it doesn&#39, t happen that fast.this is truly awesome. this could be the future of computer, without the personal computer anymore. the only concern is playback quality: dex mode streaming speed, FPS, and the response time and colors quality, and the extend of sound latency of video playback.WOWIm jealousI guess it&#39, s one for all except gaming with 60 Hz refresh rate and 8ms response time... Wish Samsung could put a real one for all together.      At 1:44the monitor isn&#39, t connected to any powerSo the monitor is so good that FIFA players became real can a mac mini be attached to this monitor ?Great. However, not all apps are compatible to take up the whole screen. Say a banking app, it&#39, d just take up the middle screen and you can&#39, t open it to take the whole screen.Why wont you get a TV for all of this?! Peak Samsung - over-innovating things nobody needs...Samsung should bring the feature of video recording or saving in rewind &amp,  fast forward mode in Note20ultra5g.If this feature introduced in the samsung upcoming update then it would be considered a cool feature.On the top, this make samsung more distinct as no other phone in market have this.And user can edit the video in rewind &amp,  fast forward mode User can able to make some cool stuff from this feature. #Samsungplease think about this.Samsung -we touch your heart  Apple -we touch your kidneys I threw my iphone OVER THE HORIZON when is this availableSamsung the best I can&#39, t wait to play realistic football in my Samsung Smart Monitor!when can i order it in hong kong ?Ordered one Today.

Most people simple have a laptop or/and PC. It is like Chromebook... Looks cool and is cost effective I guess0:28Old Skyline notificationThey should make this monitor with 120hz refresh rate then it would be perfectwho dat chick? instagram?Android on mobile phone is a mess. Android on PC must be something bigger....something to make you to commit suicide. Asians can only make a copy. Innovations is made somewhere else...you know whereThat is the most annoying and ancient notification text I have ever heard.I hear alot of rumors sayx note Will be replaced by fold. Pls don&#39, t do that Samsung Wow it is perfect, no words to saySomeone will soon ask if this monitor is 120hz refresh rate, like everything now a day should be all about gaming..2011212357Me: I need a smart TVYouTube recommendation: <b>After spending much on smart TV</b>YouTube recommendation: Smart Monitor: The One For All Life&#39, s TasksSo really, no one is gonna talk about that guy pretending to play FIFA on this thing while in actuality the footage was of a live football/socer-game?But can it run crysisI heard a Navi LISTEN in thereThis looks useful, but plugging in a Chromebook/box would be more useful.Shut up and take my moneyPlay the video No Prime video Looks interestingSamsung can commentAnd thats goodwe want Snapdragon in India or else only oneplus preferred!I miss not having the pulse oximeter on my new Galaxy S20+ 5G :(I will continue using Samsung till I dieI hope to find a job at Samsung one dayGreat work Samsung Samsung please make more  productivity apps to run in Dex to attract more people to use the platform. 90% of them already exist but please make an app like LumaFusion in Dex.... We will have a full pc like experience and truly use Dex every day without going back to main pc. That will be nice  (ps: forget about adobe rush...)ALTRO CHE APPLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEwhy only china ?Need to find out that girls instagram help me out boys and girls!Now I&#39, m hearing y&#39, all ending the note series Whats the name of this monitor? How much does it coast?Was that fifa 2077? 1:33&quot, Samsung monitor: The One for All Life&#39, s Tasks&quot, Me: ALLLLLLLLLLL MIGHTOOOOOOOOOOOOeh, an iMac would look more aesthetic in that architecture.  If apple  were to make this monitor  how much do you think it would cost ??   Comment Here ! not oled =&gt,  backlight bleed, color shift from the sides, poor darks, poor contrast, not life likeI want and hope Samsung will let the next smartphone S30 or S21 series have the same back design as the Samsung Galaxy S10 Series, because I find it the best design that I have ever seen on Samsung smartphones. As for the Note 30 or Note 21 series I want it you can do better in terms of design for it to look like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I know this is my subjective assessment but probably a lot of people also think like me and I hope Samsung can meet the needs of a customer or a fan of Samsung like me in particular and of everyone in general.What&#39, s th. Cost SamThat guy was playing a live football match? Oh...Dang she cute lolNext time make the speakers front firing for the 2nd gen smart monitor.Also, can you make an OLED version as an option with 120Hz???

Wait what? Cannot do that on my Tab S7+ unless I tap the send button or mouse over and click it. As for the video, this monitor looks neat. Hope it is priced decently, maybe will pick it up.Samsung DeX is the most useful feature today and apple will take another 2yrs to bring something like that. Hope at least they will get rid of that notch.
